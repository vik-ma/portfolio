# Portfolio Website

This project is my **Developer Portfolio Website**. The Portfolio is a compilation of the personal programming projects I've developed, and provides brief information about the projects, including pictures, a list of the technologies used, and links to visit the projects! 

### **[Check out the Portfolio here, hosted on Vercel!](https://vik-ma.vercel.app/)**

The website was designed by me, **Viktor Magnusson**, and made using **React**, **TypeScript**, **Next.js 13** and **Tailwind CSS**. The brand new **Parallel Routing** feature introduced in **Next.js 13.3** is used to render the different pages on the site in modals, instead of sending the user to a brand new page!
